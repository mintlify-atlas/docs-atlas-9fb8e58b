Petal offers flexible recording modes to fit your workflow—from quick voice notes to longer dictation sessions. You can control recording with keyboard shortcuts or the menu bar interface.

## Recording Modes

Petal supports two recording modes:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Push-to-Talk" icon="hand">
    Hold your keyboard shortcut to record, release to stop and transcribe
  </Card>
  <Card title="Toggle Recording" icon="toggle-on">
    Press once to start recording, press again to stop and transcribe
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Push-to-Talk Mode

Push-to-talk is ideal for quick voice notes and short recordings.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Hold your recording shortcut">
    Press and hold your configured keyboard shortcut (default: `Option + Space`)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Speak your message">
    The menu bar icon changes to a recording indicator (`record.circle.fill`) and a floating capsule appears showing the recording level
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Release to transcribe">
    Release the keyboard shortcut to stop recording and begin transcription
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If you hold the key for less than the push-to-talk threshold (default: 2.0 seconds), Petal automatically switches to toggle recording mode and continues recording until you press the shortcut again.
</Note>

### Toggle Recording Mode

Toggle recording is perfect for longer recordings where holding a key would be inconvenient.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Tap your recording shortcut">
    Quickly press and release your keyboard shortcut (hold for less than 2 seconds)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Petal enters toggle mode">
    You'll see the message: "Listening — tap your shortcut to stop."
    The recording continues hands-free
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Tap again to transcribe">
    Press your shortcut again to stop recording and begin transcription
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
You can customize the push-to-talk threshold in Settings to control how long you need to hold the key before it's considered push-to-talk vs. toggle mode. Options are:
- **Short**: 0.4 seconds
- **Medium**: 1.0 seconds  
- **Long**: 2.0 seconds (default)
</Tip>

## Menu Bar Controls

The menu bar icon provides visual feedback about Petal's current state:

## Canceling a Recording

If you want to cancel a recording without transcribing it:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Press Escape while recording">
    Press the `Esc` key during an active recording session
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm cancellation">
    A confirmation prompt appears in the floating capsule
    - Press `Y` or `Return` to confirm cancellation
    - Press `N` or `Esc` to continue recording
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deep Link Control

You can control recording programmatically using deep links:

```bash
# Start recording (toggle mode)
open "petal://start"

# Stop recording and transcribe
open "petal://stop"

# Toggle recording state
open "petal://toggle"

# Open onboarding/setup flow
open "petal://setup"

# Check for app updates
open "petal://check-for-updates"
```

<Info>
Deep links are useful for automation with tools like Alfred, Raycast, or shell scripts. The `setup` command is helpful for re-running onboarding if needed.

## Permissions Required

For recording to work, Petal requires:

- **Microphone Access**: Required to capture audio
- **Accessibility Access**: Required to automatically paste transcriptions (optional - transcriptions will be copied to clipboard if not granted)

Petal will prompt you for these permissions when you first try to record.

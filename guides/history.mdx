Petal maintains a comprehensive history of your transcriptions, storing both the text and original audio files (based on your retention settings).

## How History Works

Every transcription is automatically saved with detailed metadata:

- **Transcript text** - The final transcription result
- **Audio recording** - Original or compressed audio file
- **Timestamp** - When the recording was made
- **Model used** - Which transcription model processed it
- **Transcription mode** - Verbatim or Smart
- **Duration** - Length of the audio recording
- **Processing time** - How long transcription took
- **Paste result** - Whether auto-paste succeeded

<Info>
Petal groups history entries by day and stores up to 200 entries per day. Older entries are automatically removed when this limit is reached.
</Info>

## Retention Modes

Control what Petal saves by choosing a retention mode in Settings > History:

<Accordion title="Off">
  No history is saved. Use this when:
  - Privacy is paramount
  - You're transcribing sensitive information
  - You don't need to reference past transcriptions
  
  <Warning>
  When switched to "Off", Petal immediately deletes all existing history files and folders.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Transcripts Only">
  Saves text transcriptions but not audio files.
  
  **What's saved:**
  - Transcript text files (.txt)
  - Metadata (model, duration, timestamp, etc.)
  
  **What's not saved:**
  - Audio recordings
  
  **Storage impact:** Minimal (~1-5 KB per transcription)
  
  **Use when:**
  - You need searchable history
  - Disk space is limited
  - You don't need to replay audio
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Audio Only">
  Saves audio recordings but not text transcriptions.
  
  **What's saved:**
  - Audio files (.m4a)
  - Basic metadata (timestamp, duration)
  
  **What's not saved:**
  - Transcript text
  
  **Storage impact:** Moderate (~100-500 KB per minute)
  
  **Use when:**
  - You want to re-transcribe with different models
  - Audio is the primary artifact
  - You need proof of original recordings
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Audio + Transcripts (Default)">
  Saves both audio and text for complete history.
  
  **What's saved:**
  - Audio files (.m4a)
  - Transcript text files (.txt)
  - Full metadata
  
  **Storage impact:** Full (~100-500 KB per minute + text)
  
  **Use when:**
  - You need complete records
  - Verifying transcription accuracy is important
  - You might re-process recordings later
</Accordion>

## History Storage

### File Organization

Petal stores history in a structured directory:

```
~/Documents/petal/history/
├── history.json              # Index with all metadata
├── media/                    # Audio recordings
│   └── 20260228-143022-qwen3-asr-0.6b-4bit.m4a
└── transcripts/              # Transcript text files
    ├── 20260228-143022-qwen3-asr-0.6b-4bit-verbatim.txt
    └── 20260228-143022-qwen3-asr-0.6b-4bit-smart.txt
```

<Note>
When using Smart mode with Apple Intelligence, Petal saves two transcript variants: the original verbatim transcription and the AI-refined version.
</Note>

### File Naming

Files follow this naming pattern:

```
YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-{model-id}-{mode}.{ext}
```

**Example:**
```
20260228-143022-qwen3-asr-0.6b-4bit-verbatim.txt
```

This makes it easy to:
- Sort files chronologically
- Identify which model was used
- Distinguish between transcription modes

### Compression

Audio files are automatically compressed to AAC format (.m4a) when saved:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Standard Compression (Default)">
    - Sample rate: 22,050 Hz
    - Bitrate: 64 kbps
    - Good balance of quality and size
    - ~4-8 MB per hour of audio
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Extra Compression (Optional)">
    - Sample rate: 16,000 Hz  
    - Bitrate: 24 kbps
    - Smaller file size, reduced quality
    - ~1.5-3 MB per hour of audio
    
    Enable in Settings > History > Extra compression
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Even with standard compression, Petal reduces file sizes by 70-90% compared to raw recordings while maintaining sufficient quality for transcription verification.
</Tip>

## Viewing History

### Recent Entries (Settings)

Access your 20 most recent transcriptions directly in Settings > History:

- View transcript preview (truncated to 2 lines)
- See relative timestamps ("5 minutes ago", "2 hours ago")
- Quick copy to clipboard with one click

### Full History (Finder)

Click "Open in Finder" in Settings > History to access the complete history folder where you can:

- Browse all saved files
- Search transcript text files
- Play audio recordings
- Sort by date, size, or name
- Export specific files

## Exporting History

Since history is stored as standard files, you can easily export or back up your data:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open History Folder">
    Settings > History > Open in Finder
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Files">
    Choose specific files or copy the entire `history` folder
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Export">
    Copy files to:
    - External drive for backup
    - Cloud storage (Dropbox, iCloud, etc.)
    - Archive for long-term storage
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
The `history.json` file is required for Petal to recognize and display your history. If you restore files, make sure to include this index file.
</Note>

## Managing Storage

### Check Disk Usage

To see how much space your history is using:

1. Open history folder (Settings > History > Open in Finder)
2. Right-click the `history` folder
3. Select "Get Info"
4. View "Size" field

### Clear History

Petal provides two cleanup options:

<Accordion title="Delete All History & Media">
  **Removes:**
  - All transcription history entries
  - All audio files in `media/`
  - All transcript files in `transcripts/`
  - The `history.json` index
  
  **Use when:**
  - You want a fresh start
  - Freeing maximum disk space
  - Clearing sensitive data
  
  <Warning>
  This operation cannot be undone. All files are permanently deleted.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Delete Media Only">
  **Removes:**
  - All audio files in `media/`
  
  **Keeps:**
  - Transcript text files
  - History entries (visible in Recent list)
  - The `history.json` index
  
  **Use when:**
  - You need to free space but want to keep transcripts
  - Audio files are large and no longer needed
  - You only reference text, not recordings
  
  <Tip>
  This is a good middle-ground option when disk space is tight but you still want searchable history.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

## Privacy Considerations

<Warning>
All transcription processing happens **on-device**. Your audio and transcripts are never sent to external servers.
</Warning>

### File Protection

Petal applies macOS file protection to history files:
- Files are encrypted at rest (if FileVault is enabled)
- Protection level: `completeUntilFirstUserAuthentication`
- Accessible after first login, even when locked

### Deleting Sensitive Data

If you've transcribed sensitive information:

1. **Immediate cleanup**: Settings > History > Delete All History & Media
2. **Verify deletion**: Check that `~/Documents/petal/history/` is empty
3. **Consider retention mode**: Switch to "Off" for future sessions

<Tip>
For maximum privacy during sensitive work, set retention to "Off" before recording. This prevents any files from being saved.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting History

<Accordion title="History not showing recent transcriptions">
  **Possible causes:**
  - Retention mode is set to "Off"
  - Disk is full (check available space)
  - History folder permissions issue
  
  **Solutions:**
  1. Check Settings > History > Retention mode
  2. Verify disk space availability
  3. Try opening history folder in Finder to check permissions
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Missing audio or transcript files">
  **Possible causes:**
  - Retention mode changed (cleans up non-matching files)
  - Files manually deleted from Finder
  - Incomplete transcription (error during saving)
  
  **Solutions:**
  - Check retention mode setting
  - Petal "heals" history by removing entries with missing files on next launch
  - Future transcriptions will save correctly
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can't open history folder">
  **Possible causes:**
  - First transcription hasn't been made yet
  - Retention mode is "Off"
  - Permissions issue
  
  **Solutions:**
  1. Make at least one transcription with retention enabled
  2. Check that retention mode is not "Off"
  3. Manually navigate to `~/Documents/petal/history/` in Finder

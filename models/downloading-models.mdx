## Model Download Sizes

Plan your downloads based on available storage:

## How to Download Models

### During Initial Setup

When you first launch Petal, you'll see an onboarding flow:

1. **Select a model** from the available options
2. Click **Download Model** to begin
3. Wait for the download to complete
4. Click **Finish Setup** to start using Petal

<Accordion title="Download Progress Information">
  During download, you'll see:
  - **Progress bar**: Visual indicator of download completion
  - **Percentage**: Exact completion percentage (0-100%)
  - **Speed**: Current download speed (e.g., "5.2 MB/s")
  - **Status**: Current operation (preparing, downloading, installing)
</Accordion>

### After Initial Setup

You can download additional models anytime:

1. Open **Petal Settings**
2. Navigate to **Models** section
3. Select a model from the dropdown
4. If the model isn't downloaded, click **Download**
5. Wait for download to complete

## Download States

Models progress through several states during download:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Not Downloaded">
    Model is available but not yet on your system. Click Download to begin.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Preparing">
    Download is initializing. Petal is setting up the download connection.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Downloading">
    Active download in progress. You'll see progress percentage and speed.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Downloaded">
    Model is fully downloaded and ready to use. You can now start transcribing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Downloads

### Pausing Downloads

You can pause an active download:

1. Click **Pause** during download
2. The download will pause at current progress
3. Click **Resume** to continue from where you left off

<Info>
Paused downloads retain their progress. You won't need to restart from the beginning.
</Info>

### Canceling Downloads

To cancel a download completely:

1. Click **Cancel** during download
2. The partial download will be removed
3. You'll need to restart the download from the beginning if you want to try again

<Warning>
Canceling a download removes all progress. Use Pause instead if you plan to resume later.
</Warning>

### Deleting Models

To free up storage space, you can delete downloaded models:

1. Go to **Petal Settings** → **Models**
2. Select the model you want to delete
3. Click **Delete Model**
4. Confirm the deletion

<Note>
Deleting a model removes it from your system but keeps it available for re-download. You won't lose the ability to use it later.
</Note>

## Download Troubleshooting

### Download Failed

If a download fails:

<Accordion title="Check Internet Connection">
  - Ensure you have stable internet connectivity
  - Try pausing and resuming the download
  - Check if your firewall is blocking downloads
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Insufficient Storage">
  - Verify you have enough free disk space
  - See model sizes above for space requirements
  - Delete unused models to free up space
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Download Speed Issues">
  - Large models can take time on slower connections
  - Pause other downloads/uploads for faster speeds
  - Try downloading during off-peak hours
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="aria2 Binary Missing">
  If you see an "aria2 binary missing" error:
  - This indicates a missing download component
  - Try reinstalling Petal
  - Contact support if the issue persists
</Accordion>

### Download Taking Too Long

Estimated download times by connection speed:

**For Qwen3 ASR (~2.5 GB)**:
- 100 Mbps: ~3-4 minutes
- 50 Mbps: ~7-8 minutes
- 25 Mbps: ~13-15 minutes

**For Voxtral bf16 (~9.4 GB)**:
- 100 Mbps: ~12-15 minutes
- 50 Mbps: ~25-30 minutes
- 25 Mbps: ~50-60 minutes

<Info>
Download times vary based on server load and network conditions. The app shows estimated speed during download.
</Info>

## Where Models Are Stored

Downloaded models are stored locally on your Mac:

- Models are cached in your system's application support directory
- Each model has its own directory with all necessary files
- Models persist between app launches
- Deleting Petal does not automatically delete downloaded models

<Warning>
Model directories can be large. Use the built-in delete function rather than manually removing files.
</Warning>

## Download Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start Small" icon="seedling">
    Download smaller models first (Whisper Tiny, Qwen3) to test functionality before committing to large downloads.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Use Wi-Fi" icon="wifi">
    Download models over Wi-Fi rather than cellular to avoid data charges and ensure faster speeds.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Monitor Space" icon="hard-drive">
    Keep an eye on available storage. Having multiple large models can consume significant space.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Keep Favorites" icon="heart">
    Download and keep 2-3 models for different use cases rather than constantly downloading and deleting.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Multiple Model Management

You can have multiple models downloaded simultaneously:

- **Switch instantly** between downloaded models
- **No re-download** needed when switching
- **Compare performance** across different models
- **Choose per task** - use fast models for quick notes, accurate models for important content

<Note>
Each model operates independently. Downloading a new model doesn't affect existing models.
</Note>

description: How Petal handles your data with a local-first approach
---

Petal is designed with privacy as a core principle, keeping your transcriptions and audio data on your device.

## Local-First Design

<Info>
  Petal is **designed for local transcription workflows** and keeps the experience on-device where possible.
</Info>

All transcription processing happens entirely on your Mac. Your audio recordings and transcriptions never leave your device.

## What Stays Local

## Network Activity

Petal only connects to the internet for specific purposes:

### Model Downloads

<Note>
  The **only** network activity is downloading transcription models from **Hugging Face** when you first select a model.
</Note>

When you choose a transcription model that requires downloading:

1. Petal connects to Hugging Face repositories
2. Downloads the model files to your Mac
3. Caches them locally for future use

**Models are downloaded from these Hugging Face repositories:**

- `FluidInference/qwen3-asr-0.6b-coreml/f32` (Qwen3 ASR)
- `FluidInference/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-coreml` (Parakeet)
- `argmaxinc/whisperkit-coreml` (Whisper models)
- `mlx-community/Voxtral-Mini-3B-2507-bf16` (Voxtral BF16)
- `mzbac/voxtral-mini-3b-8bit` (Voxtral 8-bit)

After the initial download, **no network connection is required** for transcription.

### Software Updates

<Info>
  Petal uses **Sparkle** for automatic updates. When enabled, the app checks for new versions from the official GitHub repository.
</Info>

Update checks connect to:
- `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aayush9029/petal/main/appcast.xml`

You can disable automatic update checks in the app's preferences if desired.

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally on your Mac:

### Location

- **Transcription models**: Cached in your local model directory after download
- **History**: Stored locally using the `HistoryClient`
- **Temporary audio**: Created during transcription, automatically cleaned up after processing

### Temporary Files

During transcription, Petal may create temporary audio files for processing:

- **Audio trimming**: When silence trimming is enabled
- **Speed adjustment**: When auto-speed is enabled

<Note>
  All temporary audio files are **automatically deleted** after transcription completes, whether successful or failed.
</Note>

From the source code (TranscriptionClient.swift:136-139):

```swift
defer {
    for generatedURL in generatedAudioURLs {
        try? FileManager.default.removeItem(at: generatedURL)
    }
}
```

## User Control

You have complete control over your data:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Data Retention" icon="trash">
    You control how long transcription history is kept and can delete it at any time.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Model Management" icon="download">
    You choose which models to download and can remove them to free up disk space.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Permissions" icon="shield">
    You grant microphone and accessibility permissions and can revoke them in System Settings at any time.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Auto-Update" icon="arrow-up">
    Automatic update checks can be disabled if you prefer manual updates.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Permissions Explained

Petal requires two system permissions, both clearly defined in the app:

### Microphone Permission

<Info>
  **Purpose**: "Petal records audio while you hold your push-to-talk shortcut."
</Info>

This permission is only used to:
- Capture audio when you activate the push-to-talk shortcut
- Process the recording locally for transcription

**Not used for**:
- Background recording
- Always-on listening
- Sending audio to external servers

### Accessibility Permission

<Info>
  **Purpose**: Required for global keyboard shortcuts to work system-wide.
</Info>

This permission enables:
- Push-to-talk shortcuts that work in any application
- Automatic pasting of transcription results

**Not used for**:
- Monitoring your activity
- Accessing other applications' data
- Tracking keystrokes outside of Petal's shortcuts

## Apple Speech Framework

When using the Apple Speech model (macOS 26+):

<Note>
  The **Apple Speech** transcriber uses Apple's on-device Speech framework. This is a system-level framework that processes audio locally.
</Note>

No additional permissions beyond microphone access are required. Apple's privacy policy for the Speech framework applies:

- On-device processing
- No data sent to Apple servers
- Uses installed dictation languages from System Settings

## Privacy Statement

From the Petal README:

> Petal is designed for local transcription workflows and keeps the experience on-device where possible.

This means:

1. **No cloud transcription**: All models run locally on your Mac
2. **No data collection**: Petal does not collect analytics, telemetry, or usage data
3. **No account required**: No sign-up, login, or user account needed
4. **No external APIs**: Beyond model downloads, no API calls to external services

<Warning>
  While Petal itself maintains a strict local-first approach, be aware that downloaded models come from Hugging Face repositories. Review the model licenses and terms before downloading if you have specific compliance requirements.
</Warning>

## Open Source Transparency

Petal is open source, allowing you to:

- Inspect the complete source code
- Verify privacy claims
- Review how permissions are used
- Understand data flows
- Build from source if desired

**Repository**: [github.com/Aayush9029/petal](https://github.com/Aayush9029/petal)

<Info>
  The local-first architecture is visible throughout the codebase, with all transcription clients designed for on-device processing.

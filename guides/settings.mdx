Petal provides extensive customization options across three settings panes: General, Transcription, and History. Access settings from the menu bar icon.

## General Settings

<Accordion title="Keyboard Shortcut">
  ### Push to Talk
  
  Customize your keyboard shortcut for recording:
  - **Tap** to toggle recording on/off
  - **Hold and release** to stop recording immediately
  
  ### Hold Duration
  
  Set the threshold that determines tap vs. hold behavior:
  - **Short** (0.4s) - Quick response for rapid workflows
  - **Medium** (1.0s) - Balanced default
  - **Long** (2.0s) - Prevents accidental toggles
  
  <Info>
  When you release before the threshold, Petal enters toggle mode and displays "Listening — tap your shortcut to stop."
  </Info>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permissions">
  Petal requires two system permissions to function:
  
  ### Microphone Access
  Required to record audio for transcription. Grant access through the settings interface or System Settings.
  
  <Warning>
  Without microphone permission, recording will fail with an error. Petal will prompt you to enable access in System Settings.
  </Warning>
  
  ### Accessibility Access
  Required to auto-paste transcriptions into your active application. Without this permission, Petal will copy transcriptions to your clipboard instead.
  
  <Tip>
  If you see "Accessibility access is needed to paste" after transcription, enable this permission in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Clipboard">
  ### Restore Clipboard After Paste
  
  When enabled (default), Petal restores your previous clipboard contents after auto-pasting a transcription.
  
  This is useful when:
  - You have important content on your clipboard
  - You frequently paste the same content multiple times
  - You use clipboard managers that expect clipboard persistence
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Diagnostics">
  ### Enable Logs
  
  Disabled by default to avoid creating log files unless explicitly needed. Enable this when:
  - Troubleshooting transcription issues
  - Reporting bugs to the Petal team
  - Diagnosing performance problems
  
  ### Export Logs
  
  Once logging is enabled and logs are generated, use the Export Logs button to save diagnostic information for troubleshooting.
</Accordion>

## Transcription Settings

<Accordion title="Model Selection">
  Choose from multiple transcription models with different performance characteristics:
  
  - **Apple Speech** (Built-in, macOS 26+) - No download required
  - **Qwen3 ASR 0.6B** (Recommended) - Fast multilingual, ~2.5 GB
  - **Parakeet TDT 0.6B** - Top leaderboard accuracy, 110x real-time speed
  - **Whisper Large V3 Turbo** - 99 languages, ~1.6 GB
  - **Whisper Tiny** - Smallest/fastest, ~150 MB
  - **Voxtral Mini 3B** - Smart transcription with native Q&A support
  
  <Info>
  Models requiring download show a "Download Model" button. Downloaded models display a green checkmark. You can delete downloaded models to free up disk space.
  </Info>
  
  After changing models, Petal automatically warms up the new model for optimal performance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Audio Preprocessing">
  ### Trim Silence
  
  Removes silent segments from the start and end of your recording before transcription. This can:
  - Speed up transcription
  - Improve accuracy by removing dead air
  - Reduce storage size for history
  
  ### Auto Speed-up
  
  Speeds up quiet or low-energy audio segments to reduce transcription time without affecting quality. Particularly useful for:
  - Long pauses between sentences
  - Recordings with extended silence
  - Variable-pace speech
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Apple Intelligence">
  Available on macOS 26+ with Apple Intelligence enabled.
  
  ### Enhance with Apple Intelligence
  
  Post-processes transcriptions on-device to fix:
  - Grammar and punctuation
  - Formatting and capitalization
  - Sentence structure
  
  <Note>
  When enabled, this feature enables Smart mode for all models, even those that don't natively support it (like Whisper and Qwen).
  </Note>
  
  <Warning>
  Requires macOS 26 with Apple Intelligence enabled in System Settings.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Transcription Mode">
  Choose how Petal processes your speech:
  
  ### Verbatim Mode
  Word-for-word transcription with no post-processing. Use when:
  - You need exact wording
  - Dictating code or technical content
  - Recording conversations verbatim
  
  ### Smart Mode
  Refines transcription using a custom prompt. Available when:
  - Using Voxtral models (native support)
  - Using any model with Apple Intelligence enabled
  
  <Info>
  When using Smart mode with non-Voxtral models, Apple Intelligence post-processes the verbatim transcript according to your smart prompt.
  </Info>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Smart Prompt">
  Customize how Smart mode refines your transcriptions. The default prompt is:
  
  > Clean up filler words and repeated phrases. Return a polished version of what was said.
  
  You can modify this to:
  - Format transcriptions as bullet points
  - Summarize lengthy recordings
  - Apply specific writing styles
  - Extract action items or key points
  
  <Tip>
  Smart prompts work best with clear, specific instructions. Experiment with different prompts to find what works for your workflow.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

## History Settings

<Accordion title="Retention Mode">
  Control what Petal saves from your transcriptions:
  
  - **Off** - No history saved
  - **Transcripts** - Text only, no audio files
  - **Audio** - Audio recordings only, no text
  - **Audio + Transcripts** (Default) - Both audio and text
  
  <Note>
  Changing retention mode cleans up existing files that don't match the new mode. For example, switching from "Audio + Transcripts" to "Transcripts" deletes all audio files.
  </Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Compression">
  ### Extra Compression
  
  History audio is saved as AAC (.m4a) by default at standard quality:
  - **Standard**: 22,050 Hz sample rate, 64 kbps bitrate
  - **Extra compression**: 16,000 Hz sample rate, 24 kbps bitrate
  
  Enable extra compression when:
  - Disk space is limited
  - You have many saved recordings
  - Audio quality for playback is less important
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Storage Location">
  History files are stored at:
  
  ```
  ~/Documents/petal/history/
  ├── media/          # Audio files (.m4a)
  ├── transcripts/    # Text files (.txt)
  └── history.json    # Metadata index
  ```
  
  Use "Open in Finder" to access your history folder directly.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Clear Data">
  Two options for clearing history:
  
  ### Delete All History & Media
  Permanently removes:
  - All transcription history entries
  - All audio files
  - All transcript text files
  
  ### Delete Media Only
  Removes all audio files while keeping:
  - Transcription history entries
  - Transcript text files
  
  <Warning>
  Both operations are permanent and cannot be undone. Your files will be deleted from disk immediately.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

## Recent History

The History settings pane shows your 20 most recent transcriptions with:
- Preview of transcript text (truncated)
- Relative timestamp ("5 minutes ago")
- Quick copy button to copy the transcript

<Tip>
Click the copy icon next to any recent entry to copy its transcript to your clipboard without leaving settings.

# Quickstart Guide

This guide will walk you through recording and transcribing your first audio with Petal.

<Note>
Before starting, make sure you've completed the [Installation](/installation) steps and granted the required permissions.
</Note>

## Get Your First Transcription

<Steps>
  <Step title="Launch Petal">
    Open Petal from your Applications folder. You'll see the Petal icon appear in your menu bar at the top-right of your screen.
    
    The icon indicates Petal's status:
    - **Ready** - All set to record
    - **Recording** - Currently capturing audio
    - **Transcribing** - Processing your audio
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Grant permissions">
    If this is your first time launching Petal, you'll be prompted to grant two permissions:
    
    **Microphone Access**: Click **OK** when macOS asks for microphone permission.
    
    **Accessibility Access**: Click **Enable Accessibility Access** from the Petal menu, then add Petal in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility.
    
    <Info>
    See the [Installation](/installation#required-permissions) guide for detailed permission instructions.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose a transcription model">
    Click the Petal menu bar icon and select **Settings**.
    
    On first launch, Petal will guide you through onboarding where you can select a transcription model:
    
    - **Qwen3 ASR 0.6B** (recommended) - Fast multilingual transcription, ~2.5 GB download
    - **Parakeet TDT 0.6B** - Top accuracy with 110x real-time speed
    - **Whisper Large V3 Turbo** - High accuracy across 99 languages, ~1.6 GB
    - **Whisper Tiny** - Smallest and fastest, ~150 MB
    - **Apple Speech** - Built-in, no download (requires macOS 26+)
    - **Voxtral Mini 3B** - Advanced features including Q&A and summarization
    
    <Note>
    Most models require a one-time download. The download happens automatically and progress is shown in the Petal menu.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start recording">
    There are two ways to start recording:
    
    **Option 1: Keyboard shortcut (recommended)**
    
    Press and hold **Option + Space** (⌥ + Space) to start recording. A floating capsule will appear showing recording status.
    
    **Option 2: Menu bar**
    
    Click the Petal icon in your menu bar. If recording is available, you'll see recording controls.
    
    <Info>
    The keyboard shortcut works from any app. You can customize it in Settings > Shortcuts.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Speak your audio">
    While holding the shortcut (or after clicking record), speak clearly into your microphone.
    
    The floating capsule shows:
    - **Visual waveform** indicating audio is being captured
    - **Duration** of your recording
    - **Model name** being used for transcription
    
    Speak naturally - Petal handles noise and pauses automatically.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Stop and transcribe">
    Release the keyboard shortcut (or click stop) to end recording.
    
    Petal will immediately begin transcribing your audio:
    1. The capsule shows "Transcribing..." with a progress indicator
    2. When complete, the transcription is automatically copied to your clipboard
    3. You'll see a confirmation that the text is ready to paste
    
    Paste anywhere (Cmd + V) to use your transcription.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Transcription Modes

Petal supports two transcription modes:

### Verbatim Mode

Word-for-word transcription of exactly what you said.

- Available on all models
- Fast and accurate
- No processing or refinement
- Best for: dictation, notes, meeting transcripts

### Smart Mode

Refines transcription with a custom prompt for improved clarity and formatting.

- Only available on Voxtral models (Mini 3B, Mini 3B 8-bit)
- Can answer questions, summarize, or reformat your speech
- Slightly slower than verbatim
- Best for: cleaned-up notes, summaries, Q&A from voice

<Info>
Switch between modes in Settings > Transcription. Smart mode requires a Voxtral model to be selected.
</Info>

## Viewing History

Petal keeps a history of your transcriptions for easy access:

1. Click the Petal menu bar icon
2. Select **History**
3. Click any past transcription to copy it to your clipboard

Each history entry shows:
- Transcription preview
- Timestamp
- Model used
- Duration

<Note>
You can configure history retention in Settings > Privacy. Options include keeping history for 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, or forever.
</Note>

## Customizing Your Workflow

### Change the Keyboard Shortcut

The default push-to-talk shortcut is Option + Space, but you can customize it:

1. Open **Settings** from the Petal menu
2. Go to **Shortcuts**
3. Click the shortcut field and press your preferred key combination
4. Close settings to save

### Switch Models

Different models excel at different tasks. To switch models:

1. Open **Settings**
2. Go to **Models**
3. Select your preferred model
4. If needed, Petal will download the model automatically

See [Models Overview](/models/overview) for detailed comparisons.

### Adjust Recording Threshold

If Petal is too sensitive or not sensitive enough to voice:

1. Open **Settings**
2. Go to **Recording**
3. Adjust the **Push-to-Talk Threshold**
   - Lower = more sensitive (picks up quieter speech)
   - Higher = less sensitive (ignores background noise)

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keyboard shortcut not working">
    Make sure you've granted Accessibility permission:
    
    1. Open **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility**
    2. Enable Petal in the list
    3. Restart Petal
    
    If still not working, try changing the shortcut to avoid conflicts with other apps.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="No audio being recorded">
    Verify microphone permission:
    
    1. Open **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone**
    2. Enable Petal
    3. Check that your microphone is selected in **System Settings > Sound > Input**
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Transcription is inaccurate">
    Try these solutions:
    
    - Speak more clearly and reduce background noise
    - Switch to a higher-quality model (e.g., Whisper Large V3 Turbo)
    - Adjust recording threshold in Settings
    - Ensure your microphone is working properly
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Model download failing">
    Model downloads require an internet connection and storage space:
    
    - Check your internet connection
    - Ensure you have enough free disk space (models range from 150 MB to 9.4 GB)
    - Try restarting Petal and downloading again
    - Check the download status in Settings > Models
  </Accordion>

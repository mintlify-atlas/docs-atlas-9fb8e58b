## Required Permissions

Petal requires two critical system permissions to function:

<Warning>
  You **must** grant both permissions during the onboarding process. Without these permissions, Petal cannot record or transcribe audio.
</Warning>

### 1. Microphone Access

**Purpose**: Petal records audio while you hold your push-to-talk shortcut.

**How to grant**:
- Petal will prompt you during first launch
- Or go to **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Microphone**
- Enable the toggle for Petal

<Info>
  The microphone permission is defined in `Info.plist` as:
  
  `"Petal records audio while you hold your push-to-talk shortcut."`
</Info>

### 2. Accessibility Access

**Purpose**: Required for global keyboard shortcuts to work system-wide.

**How to grant**:
- Petal will prompt you during onboarding
- Or go to **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Accessibility**
- Enable the toggle for Petal

<Warning>
  Without Accessibility permission, Petal's push-to-talk keyboard shortcuts will not function.
</Warning>

## Model Storage Requirements

Different transcription models require varying amounts of disk space:

| Model | Download Size | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| Apple Speech | No download | Built-in to macOS 26+ |
| Qwen3 ASR 0.6B | ~2.5 GB | Default recommended model |
| Parakeet TDT 0.6B | CoreML format | Size varies |
| Whisper Large V3 Turbo | ~1.6 GB | High accuracy |
| Whisper Tiny | ~150 MB | Smallest option |
| Voxtral Mini 3B (BF16) | ~9.4 GB | Largest, best quality |
| Voxtral Mini 3B (8-bit) | ~4.6 GB | Quantized version |

<Info>
  Models are downloaded from **Hugging Face** on first use and stored locally. Plan your disk space accordingly based on which models you want to use.
</Info>

## Performance Considerations

### Apple Silicon Optimization

All models use CoreML and are optimized for Apple Silicon Macs. Performance characteristics:

- **Speed Score**: How fast the model transcribes (1-5 scale)
- **Smart Score**: Transcription quality and intelligence (1-5 scale)

| Model | Speed Score | Smart Score |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Apple Speech | 5 | 3 |
| Qwen3 ASR | 4 | 4 |
| Parakeet TDT | 5 | 4 |
| Whisper Large V3 Turbo | 2 | 5 |
| Whisper Tiny | 4 | 2 |
| Voxtral Mini 3B (BF16) | 2 | 5 |
| Voxtral Mini 3B (8-bit) | 3 | 4 |

<Note>
  For fastest transcription, choose **Apple Speech** (macOS 26+) or **Parakeet TDT 0.6B**.
  
  For best quality, choose **Whisper Large V3 Turbo** or **Voxtral Mini 3B (BF16)**.
</Note>

## Checking Your System

### Verify macOS Version

1. Click the Apple menu () → **About This Mac**
2. Check that your macOS version is **15.0 or later**
3. For Apple Speech support, you need **macOS 26 or later**

### Verify Permissions

You can check granted permissions at any time:

1. Open **System Settings**
2. Go to **Privacy & Security**
3. Check both **Microphone** and **Accessibility** sections
4. Ensure Petal is enabled in both lists

<Warning>
  If you denied permissions during initial setup, you must grant them manually in System Settings. Petal cannot function without both Microphone and Accessibility permissions.
</Warning>

## Installation Requirements

Beyond system requirements, installation is straightforward:

1. Download the latest `.dmg` from the [releases page](https://github.com/Aayush9029/petal/releases/latest)
2. Open the `.dmg` file
3. Drag Petal to your **Applications** folder
4. Launch Petal
5. Grant the required permissions when prompted
6. Download your preferred transcription model

<Info>
  Petal uses **Sparkle** for automatic updates. When enabled, the app will check for updates automatically and notify you when new versions are available.

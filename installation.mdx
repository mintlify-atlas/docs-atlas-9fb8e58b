# Installing Petal

Get Petal running on your Mac in just a few steps.

## Download

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the latest version">
    Download the latest Petal release from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Aayush9029/petal/releases/latest).
    
    Look for the `.dmg` file in the release assets.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Open the DMG file">
    Once downloaded, open the `.dmg` file. This will mount the disk image and show you the Petal app.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Move to Applications">
    Drag the Petal app icon into your Applications folder.
    
    <Note>
    Moving to Applications ensures Petal can auto-update and run properly with system permissions.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Launch Petal">
    Open Petal from your Applications folder or Spotlight (Cmd + Space, then type "Petal").
    
    If you see a security warning about an unidentified developer, go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security** and click "Open Anyway".
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Required Permissions

Petal needs two permissions to function properly:

### Microphone Access

Petal records audio while you hold your push-to-talk shortcut.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Grant microphone permission">
    When you first launch Petal, macOS will prompt you to grant microphone access.
    
    Click **OK** to allow Petal to access your microphone.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Manual grant (if needed)">
    If you accidentally denied access, you can grant it manually:
    
    1. Open **System Settings**
    2. Go to **Privacy & Security > Microphone**
    3. Enable the toggle next to **Petal**
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Petal only accesses your microphone when you actively hold down the push-to-talk shortcut. Recording stops immediately when you release the key.
</Info>

### Accessibility Access

Accessibility permission allows Petal to listen for the global keyboard shortcut (default: Option + Space) even when other apps are active.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open accessibility settings">
    Click **Enable Accessibility Access** from the Petal menu bar icon, or:
    
    1. Open **System Settings**
    2. Go to **Privacy & Security > Accessibility**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Grant permission to Petal">
    Click the **+** button and add Petal from your Applications folder.
    
    Or enable the toggle next to Petal if it's already in the list.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Restart Petal">
    After granting accessibility permission, restart Petal for the changes to take effect.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Without accessibility permission, the global keyboard shortcut won't work. You'll need to use the menu bar to start recordings instead.
</Warning>

## Verifying Installation

Once installed, you should see the Petal icon in your menu bar at the top-right of your screen.

Click the icon to verify:
- ✅ Status shows "Ready" (not showing permission warnings)
- ✅ Menu bar shows Settings and About options
- ✅ No error messages displayed

If you see permission warnings in the menu, follow the steps above to grant the required permissions.

## Automatic Updates

Petal uses Sparkle for automatic updates. When a new version is available:

1. Petal will notify you with a dialog
2. Click **Install Update** to download and install automatically
3. Petal will restart with the new version

You can also manually check for updates by clicking **Check for Updates** in the Petal menu.

<Note>
Automatic update checks are enabled by default. You can disable them in Settings if preferred.
</Note>

## Uninstalling

To remove Petal from your Mac:

1. Quit Petal from the menu bar (click icon > Quit Petal)
2. Move Petal from Applications to Trash
3. Optionally, remove settings and history:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.optimalapps.petal
   rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.optimalapps.petal
   ```

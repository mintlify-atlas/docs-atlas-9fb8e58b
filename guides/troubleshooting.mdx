This guide covers common issues you might encounter while using Petal and how to resolve them.

## Permission Issues

<Accordion title="Microphone permission denied">
  **Symptoms:**
  - Error message: "Microphone permission denied"
  - Recording fails to start
  - Menu bar shows error icon
  
  **Solution:**
  
  <Steps>
    <Step title="Open System Settings">
      Click the Apple menu > System Settings
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Navigate to Privacy & Security">
      Select "Privacy & Security" from the sidebar
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Enable Microphone Access">
      1. Click "Microphone" in the list
      2. Find "Petal" in the app list
      3. Toggle the switch to enable access
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Return to Petal">
      Permission changes take effect immediately. Try recording again.
    </Step>
  </Steps>
  
  <Note>
  Petal monitors permission status and will detect when you grant access. You don't need to restart the app.
  </Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Auto-paste not working / Accessibility permission needed">
  **Symptoms:**
  - Transcription completes but doesn't paste
  - Message: "Accessibility access is needed to paste"
  - Text is copied to clipboard instead of pasting
  
  **Why this happens:**
  
  Petal needs Accessibility permission to simulate keyboard input and paste transcriptions into your active application.
  
  **Solution:**
  
  <Steps>
    <Step title="Open System Settings">
      Click the Apple menu > System Settings
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Navigate to Privacy & Security">
      Select "Privacy & Security" from the sidebar
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Enable Accessibility Access">
      1. Click "Accessibility" in the list
      2. Click the lock icon and authenticate if needed
      3. Find "Petal" in the app list
      4. Toggle the switch to enable access
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Test Auto-paste">
      Make a new recording to verify auto-paste works
    </Step>
  </Steps>
  
  <Tip>
  Even without Accessibility permission, Petal copies transcriptions to your clipboard. You can paste manually with Cmd+V.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission prompt not appearing">
  **Symptoms:**
  - Petal doesn't ask for microphone/accessibility permission
  - Recording fails silently
  
  **Solution:**
  
  Manually trigger permission grants from Settings:
  
  1. Open Petal settings (click menu bar icon)
  2. Go to General tab
  3. Click "Grant Access" button for the required permission
  4. Follow the system prompts
  
  If this doesn't work, manually enable permissions in System Settings as described above.
</Accordion>

## Model Issues

<Accordion title="Model download fails">
  **Symptoms:**
  - Download progress stalls or shows error
  - Error message appears below "Download Model" button
  - Download never completes
  
  **Common causes and solutions:**
  
  ### Network Issues
  - Check your internet connection
  - Disable VPN temporarily (some block model repositories)
  - Try downloading on a different network
  
  ### Disk Space
  - Verify you have enough free space (check model size in settings)
  - Models are stored in `~/Documents/petal/models/`
  - Delete old models to free space if needed
  
  ### Interrupted Downloads
  1. Click "Cancel" to stop the current download
  2. Wait a few seconds
  3. Click "Download Model" again to restart
  
  <Tip>
  If a download consistently fails, try a different model. Smaller models like "Whisper Tiny" (~150 MB) are faster to download and can help diagnose network issues.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Model download stuck at 99%">
  **Symptoms:**
  - Download progress reaches 99% but never completes
  - App appears frozen during final processing
  
  **Why this happens:**
  
  The final 1% represents model validation and preparation, which can take time for large models.
  
  **Solution:**
  
  - Wait patiently (can take 30-60 seconds for large models)
  - Do not cancel during this phase
  - If stuck for >2 minutes, cancel and retry download
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="'Model not downloaded' error when trying to record">
  **Symptoms:**
  - Pressing keyboard shortcut shows error
  - Can't start recording
  - Settings shows model as not downloaded
  
  **Solution:**
  
  <Steps>
    <Step title="Check Download Status">
      Open Settings > Transcription and verify model status
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Download the Model">
      If not downloaded, click "Download Model" and wait for completion
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Verify Disk Space">
      Ensure sufficient space for the model size shown in settings
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Try Recording">
      After download completes, the model will warm up automatically. Look for the green checkmark.
    </Step>
  </Steps>
  
  <Note>
  Petal automatically warms up models after download to ensure they're ready for use. You'll see a "Warming up..." indicator during this process.
  </Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Model warming up takes forever">
  **Symptoms:**
  - "Warming up model..." message persists
  - First transcription after app launch is very slow
  
  **Why this happens:**
  
  Model warmup loads the model into memory and performs a test transcription. This is normal and happens:
  - After downloading a new model
  - When switching models
  - On first launch after app updates
  
  **Normal warmup times:**
  - Apple Speech: 1-2 seconds
  - Whisper Tiny: 3-5 seconds
  - Qwen3/Parakeet: 10-15 seconds
  - Voxtral models: 30-60 seconds
  
  **If warmup exceeds these times:**
  1. Check Activity Monitor for high CPU usage
  2. Close other memory-intensive apps
  3. Restart Petal
  4. Try a different model to isolate the issue
</Accordion>

## Recording Issues

<Accordion title="Recording won't start">
  **Symptoms:**
  - Pressing keyboard shortcut does nothing
  - No floating capsule appears
  - Menu bar icon doesn't change
  
  **Check these in order:**
  
  1. **Keyboard shortcut set?**
     - Settings > General > Push to Talk
     - Verify a shortcut is assigned
     - Try changing to a different shortcut
  
  2. **Microphone permission granted?**
     - Settings > General > Permissions
     - Should show green checkmark
     - If not, click "Grant Access"
  
  3. **Model downloaded?**
     - Settings > Transcription > Status
     - Should show "Downloaded" or "Ready"
     - If not, download the model
  
  4. **Setup completed?**
     - Menu bar should say "Ready" when idle
     - If it says "Setup Required", complete onboarding
  
  5. **Another recording in progress?**
     - Petal only allows one recording at a time
     - Check if floating capsule is already visible
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Recording level too quiet / too loud">
  **Symptoms:**
  - Floating capsule shows no audio level
  - Audio level maxed out constantly
  - Transcription is empty or inaccurate
  
  **Solution:**
  
  Adjust your system microphone input level:
  
  1. Open System Settings > Sound
  2. Select "Input" tab
  3. Choose your microphone from the list
  4. Adjust "Input volume" slider while speaking
  5. Aim for levels that reach 50-80% when speaking normally
  
  <Warning>
  If input level is at minimum and you hear nothing, your microphone may be muted or not selected as the input device.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Recording cancels unexpectedly">
  **Symptoms:**
  - Recording stops without completing transcription
  - Message: "Recording cancelled"
  
  **Common causes:**
  
  - You pressed Escape and confirmed cancellation
  - System audio input changed (e.g., headphones disconnected)
  - Microphone access was revoked during recording
  
  **Prevention:**
  - Don't disconnect audio devices during recording
  - Avoid pressing Escape unless you want to cancel
  - Keep microphone permissions granted
</Accordion>

## Transcription Issues

<Accordion title="Transcription is empty / no speech detected">
  **Symptoms:**
  - Recording completes but transcription is empty
  - Message: "No speech detected"
  - Nothing pasted or copied
  
  **Common causes:**
  
  ### 1. Microphone Input Level Too Low
  - Check System Settings > Sound > Input
  - Increase input volume
  - Test with another app (Voice Memos) to verify microphone works
  
  ### 2. Wrong Input Device Selected
  - Ensure correct microphone is selected in System Settings
  - Some Macs have multiple input devices
  - Try switching between input devices
  
  ### 3. Recording Too Short
  - Recordings under 0.5 seconds may not be processed
  - Speak for at least 1 second
  
  ### 4. Trim Silence Too Aggressive
  - If enabled, Settings > Transcription > Trim silence
  - Try disabling this setting
  - Make a new recording
  
  <Tip>
  To test your microphone, use macOS Voice Memos app. If it records audio successfully, Petal should work too.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Transcription takes too long">
  **Symptoms:**
  - Transcription hangs at "Transcribing..." for minutes
  - Menu bar shows hourglass icon indefinitely
  
  **Expected transcription times:**
  
  For 1 minute of audio:
  - Apple Speech: ~5-10 seconds
  - Whisper Tiny: ~15-20 seconds  
  - Qwen3/Parakeet: ~20-30 seconds
  - Whisper Large V3 Turbo: ~60-90 seconds
  - Voxtral models: ~90-120 seconds
  
  **If transcription exceeds these times:**
  
  1. **Check system resources**
     - Open Activity Monitor
     - Look for high CPU usage by other apps
     - Close unnecessary applications
  
  2. **Try a faster model**
     - Switch to Apple Speech or Whisper Tiny
     - These are optimized for speed
  
  3. **Enable preprocessing**
     - Settings > Transcription > Trim silence
     - Settings > Transcription > Auto speed-up
     - Both can reduce processing time
  
  4. **Restart Petal**
     - Quit completely (Cmd+Q from menu bar)
     - Relaunch and try again
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Transcription is inaccurate">
  **Symptoms:**
  - Many words are wrong
  - Nonsensical output
  - Missing words or sentences
  
  **Improve accuracy:**
  
  ### 1. Choose a Better Model
  - Qwen3 ASR: Best for multilingual
  - Parakeet TDT: Top accuracy benchmark
  - Whisper Large V3 Turbo: Best for English
  - Voxtral: Best for natural language understanding
  
  ### 2. Improve Recording Quality
  - Speak clearly and at moderate pace
  - Reduce background noise
  - Use a better microphone if available
  - Record in a quieter environment
  
  ### 3. Adjust Settings
  - Disable "Trim silence" if it cuts off speech
  - Try both Verbatim and Smart modes
  - For Smart mode, refine your custom prompt
  
  ### 4. Language Support
  - Whisper models support 99 languages
  - Qwen3 supports 30+ languages including Chinese dialects
  - Other models are primarily English-focused
  
  <Note>
  Accuracy varies by model and use case. Experiment with different models to find the best fit for your needs.
  </Note>
</Accordion>

  </Warning>
</Accordion>

## App Behavior Issues

<Accordion title="Petal doesn't appear in menu bar">
  **Symptoms:**
  - Can't find Petal icon in menu bar
  - App seems to not be running
  
  **Solution:**
  
  1. Check if Petal is running:
     - Open Spotlight (Cmd+Space)
     - Search for "Petal"
     - Launch if not running
  
  2. Menu bar might be crowded:
     - Look for a >> icon in menu bar (indicates overflow)
     - Click it to see hidden menu bar items
     - Consider hiding other menu bar apps
  
  3. Reset menu bar:
     - Quit Petal (if running)
     - Relaunch the app
     - Icon should appear within seconds
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Keyboard shortcut doesn't work">
  **Symptoms:**
  - Pressing shortcut does nothing
  - No response from Petal
  
  **Troubleshoot:**
  
  1. **Shortcut conflict**
     - Another app may use the same shortcut
     - Try changing Petal's shortcut in Settings > General
     - Choose a unique combination
  
  2. **Accessibility permission required**
     - Some shortcuts require Accessibility access to function
     - Grant permission in System Settings
  
  3. **Keyboard not focused**
     - Click any app to ensure keyboard input is active
     - Shortcuts don't work during screensaver/lock screen
  
  <Tip>
  Good shortcut choices avoid conflicts: Opt+Shift+Space, Ctrl+Shift+R, or Cmd+Shift+M are often available.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Clipboard restore not working">
  **Symptoms:**
  - After transcription, previous clipboard content is lost
  - Expected clipboard restoration doesn't happen
  
  **Check:**
  
  1. Settings > General > Restore clipboard after paste (enabled?)
  2. Accessibility permission granted (required for clipboard access)
  
  **Known limitations:**
  
  - Only restores text clipboard content
  - Rich content (images, files) may not restore
  - Some clipboard managers may interfere
  
  If problematic, disable this setting and use a clipboard manager app instead.
</Accordion>

## Performance Issues

<Accordion title="Petal uses too much memory">
  **Symptoms:**
  - High memory usage in Activity Monitor
  - Mac becomes slow when Petal is running
  
  **Why this happens:**
  
  Large transcription models are loaded into memory:
  - Whisper Tiny: ~200 MB
  - Qwen3/Parakeet: ~3-4 GB
  - Voxtral models: ~5-10 GB
  
  **Solutions:**
  
  1. Use a smaller model (Apple Speech, Whisper Tiny)
  2. Quit Petal when not actively using it
  3. Upgrade Mac RAM if frequently transcribing
  
  <Note>
  Memory is released when you quit Petal (Cmd+Q). The app doesn't run background processes when not in use.
  </Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="First transcription after launch is slow">
  **Symptoms:**
  - First recording takes much longer to transcribe
  - Subsequent recordings are faster
  
  **Why this happens:**
  
  This is normal behavior. The model is loaded and warmed up on first use. Subsequent transcriptions reuse the loaded model and are much faster.
  
  **To avoid:**
  - Keep Petal running when actively transcribing
  - Models stay loaded in memory between uses
</Accordion>

Petal offers two transcription modes to match your needs: **Verbatim** for exact word-for-word transcription, and **Smart** for AI-polished output.

## Mode Overview

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Verbatim" icon="quote-left">
    Word-for-word transcription of exactly what was said, including filler words and repetitions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Smart" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    AI-refined transcription that cleans up filler words and repeated phrases using a custom prompt
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Verbatim Mode

Verbatim mode provides an exact transcription of your speech without any modifications.

### When to Use Verbatim

- Recording interviews or conversations where exact wording matters
- Transcribing legal or medical content
- When you want complete control over editing
- Capturing speech patterns or linguistic analysis

### Supported Models

All models support Verbatim mode:

- Apple Speech (Built-in)
- Qwen3 ASR 0.6B
- Parakeet TDT 0.6B
- Whisper Large V3 Turbo
- Whisper Tiny
- Voxtral Mini 3B (bf16)
- Voxtral Mini 3B (8-bit)

<Info>
Verbatim mode has the fastest processing time since it doesn't require additional AI refinement.
</Info>

## Smart Mode

Smart mode uses AI to refine your transcription, removing filler words and cleaning up repeated phrases for more polished output.

### How Smart Mode Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial transcription">
    Petal transcribes your audio using the selected model
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="AI refinement">
    The transcription is refined using either:
    - **Native smart support**: Voxtral models apply the prompt during transcription
    - **Apple Intelligence**: Other models use Apple's on-device AI for post-processing (requires macOS 15+ and Apple Intelligence enabled)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Polished output">
    The cleaned-up transcription is pasted to your active application
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Default Smart Prompt

By default, Smart mode uses this prompt:

```
Clean up filler words and repeated phrases. Return a polished version of what was said.
```

<Tip>
You can customize the smart prompt in Settings to match your specific needs. For example:
- "Format as bullet points"
- "Fix grammar and punctuation only"
- "Summarize the key points"
</Tip>

### Supported Models

Only Voxtral models support Smart mode natively:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Voxtral Mini 3B (bf16)" icon="brain">
    Native smart transcription with highest quality
    
    **Size**: ~9.4 GB
  </Card>
  <Card title="Voxtral Mini 3B (8-bit)" icon="brain">
    Native smart transcription with reduced memory
    
    **Size**: ~4.6 GB
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
If you select Smart mode with a model that doesn't support it natively (Apple Speech, Qwen3, Parakeet, or Whisper models), Petal will:

1. Fall back to Verbatim mode if Apple Intelligence is not available
2. Use Apple Intelligence for post-processing if available (requires macOS 15+ and Apple Intelligence enabled in Settings)

The mode will automatically normalize to Verbatim if neither option is available.
</Warning>

## Apple Intelligence Integration

For models that don't support Smart mode natively, Petal can use Apple Intelligence for post-processing.

### Requirements

- macOS 15 or later
- Apple Intelligence enabled in Petal Settings
- Compatible Mac with Apple Intelligence support

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verbatim transcription">
    The model first creates a word-for-word transcription
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="AI refinement stage">
    The menu bar icon changes to `apple.intelligence` and applies your smart prompt to clean up the text
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Both versions saved">
    Petal saves both the original verbatim transcription and the refined version in your history
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
When Apple Intelligence refines a transcription, you'll see a "Refining" stage in the processing flow. Both the original and refined versions are available in your transcription history.
</Info>

## Changing Modes

You can change transcription modes in Settings:

1. Click the Petal menu bar icon
2. Click the gear icon to open Settings  
3. Select your preferred mode from the "Transcription Mode" dropdown

<Note>
If you select Smart mode but your current model doesn't support it, Petal will automatically fall back to Verbatim mode or use Apple Intelligence if available.
</Note>
